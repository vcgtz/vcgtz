## Hi there! I'm Vicente GutiÃ©rrez
:large_blue_circle: Lead Software Engineer at Incfile <br>
:earth_americas: Based on Mexico ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½

I've been working as a software engineer since 2014 and have gained extensive experience in creating scalable, high-quality applications. I have experience with technologies like **PHP (Laravel)**, **JavaScript (NodeJS)**, and **Python**. While I prefer to work as a backend developer, I can also do fullstack work.

I have a great passion for programming and enjoy working on challenging projects that allow me to continue learning and growing as a developer.

:arrow_right: Righ now I'm focused on **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **NodeJS**, and **Python**. <br>
