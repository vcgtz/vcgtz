## Hello there! I'm Vicente 👋

I'm a Software Engineer based in Mexico. I'm working at Incfile as a **backend engineer** and ~~a fullstack engineer~~.

I've been working as a developer since 2014. I work with languages like **PHP**, **JavaScript**, and **Python**. I feel more comfortable working on the _backend_ but I can work as a _fullstack_ as well.

### I'm focused on...
_JavaScript_, _NodeJS_, and _TypeScript_.

### I'm currently learning...
_ReactJS_
